2. Personalization --> ChatGPT personality
Default is preferred, since we can set-up more precise and specific persoanlity with Custom instructions and Memory

3. Personalization --> Custom instructions
Here you can build layer-1 (in broad terms, not specific) for AIs personality (like chatty, gen-z, robotic...), Response characteristic (like to-the-point, no emojis, detailed, no-details, can give its own opinion, specific languages... )

4. Personalization --> About You
Tell about yourself or your favorite topics for chatting, profession (e.g writer, designer, students...) or your hobby (fishing, programming, cooking...) so AIs can understand the specific needs you want

5. Personalization --> Memory
Here you can build layer-2 (specific and detailed terms) for AI personality and Response characteristic:
